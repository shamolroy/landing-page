                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1500">There is a legend that a child flew to the stars in search of a special mineral that would save the dying galaxy, Metaverse 7. The child boarded a ship with his lightbot and disappeared into the heavens.</p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1500">Some say the child died. Others believe the child entered a worm hole and was torn into two opposing forces: a light side and a shadow side that continue to battle each other each one trying to claim mastery over the entire universe.</p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1500">It is said that the one that finds this child (or its two parts), will be rewarded with the ability to unite all the spark energy within the universe into one singular and powerful force. Unknown forces continue to leave clues to the childâ€™s whereabouts in the form of ciphers, and keys.</p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1500">The Sky-tellers, an ancient warrior tribe, and who once reigned supreme over the entire galaxy are now broken into several factions. They are locked in the ultimate battle of light vs. dark. Who will find the keys and claim their hold over Metaverse 7.</p>
